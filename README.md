Fall

Overview

Fall of Pinecones is a game where you play as a squirrel getting ready for Winter. You must catch falling leaves and acorns to collect enough points to survive.

How to play:

Move the squirrel left and right to catch items falling from the trees.

Leaf = 1 point

Small Acorn	= 5 points

Large Acorn =	10 points

Your goal is to reach 500 points to prepare for the Winter

Future Improvements:

Adding a timer. If you donâ€™t reach 500 points in time, you get a bad ending.

Adding 2 more mode, Hard mode (shorter timer, slower speed) + Umlimited mode (No timer, farming points)

Adding a shop system
